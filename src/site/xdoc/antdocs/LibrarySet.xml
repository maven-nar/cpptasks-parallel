<section name="libset">
<subsection name="Description">A set of library names. Libraries can also be added to a link by specifying
 them in a fileset.
 
 For most Unix-like compilers, libset will result in a series of -l and -L
 linker arguments. For Windows compilers, the library names will be used to
 locate the appropriate library files which will be added to the linkers
 input file list as if they had been specified in a fileset.</subsection>

 the linker's case sensitivity.</td>

 The library set will be ignored unless the property is defined.
 
 The value of the property is insignificant, but values that would imply
 misinterpretation ("false", "no") will throw an exception when
 evaluated.</td>

 If named property is set, the library set will be ignored.
