<subsection name="Description">Version Information.

 This information is applied in a platform specific manner
 to embed version information into executable images.  This
 behavior is new and subject to change.

 On the Microsoft Windows platform, a resource is generated and added
 to the set of files to be compiled.  A resource compiler must
 be specified to compile the generated file.

 On Unix platforms, versioninfo is currently not used.
 Future versions may append fileversion to the output file name,
 use compatibility version for -soname and possibly create
 symbolic links.</subsection>
